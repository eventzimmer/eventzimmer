Contribution guidelines
-----------------------

Well, hello there! You've come to the right place if you would like to contribute.
What belongs to the `eventzimmer` issue tracker?

- technical issues: something is not working, behaving weird (...)
- feature suggestions
- other non-trivial organization decissions

If you've come here instead to submit your source to eventzimmer, please send us an email instead:

`team at eventzimmer dot de``

When creating an issue you should include:
- the service that you want to address (api, aggregator, app)
- the version that is currently deployed (usually latest)
- as much output as you can potentially report (this includes, e.g browser version, device, console log ...)

For feature creation please also suggest a milestone that your feature could potentially fit in.
Thanks for helping out, you're rad!
